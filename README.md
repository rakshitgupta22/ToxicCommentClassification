# ToxicCommentClassification
Capstone Project for NLP Course at the university

Social media has become an essential part of our lives these days. People are interacting with one another more than ever. Not only are these social networking websites 
a medium for communication, but they have also become a hub for news circulation, education, and also e-commerce.With more and more users adding up, there is a rise in 
the number of people writing inappropriate content. This project aims to identify and flag all such comments posted on the internet and classify them into the six classes
of toxicity - toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate. In this project, various machine-learning models have been deployed using Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) techniques. Further, the performance of these models is analyzed using the F1-score as the evaluation metric.
